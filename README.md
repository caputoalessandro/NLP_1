# NLP 1

Implementation and evaluation of a POS tagger using varying smoothing techniques. Viterbi algorithm based on Hidden
Markow model was used for implementation.
The algorithm was tested on two corpuses available online:

- Perseus (Ancient Greek)
- UD Latin LLCT (Latin)

The objective of the exercise is to evaluate how the performance of the post tagger changes as the smoothing techniques vary.
